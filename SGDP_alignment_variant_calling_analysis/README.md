# Analysis of short-read alignment and variant calling in SGDP samples with T2T-CHM13v2 and GRCh38

This notebook was used to generate Supplemental Figures 14-18. The notebook describes what files were used for analysis, and how those files were generated. Some of these files are available directly from the [T2T-chrY AnVIL repo](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/anvil-datastorage/AnVIL_T2T_CHRY). Others were generated from the files present in the repo. In cases where files are not present in the repo, the process by which they were generated is described briefly in the notebook.
